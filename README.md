Data analysis of Ford GoBike sharing system


This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. A bike share program consists of making bicycles and/or electric bicycles available to the inhabitants of a city, so that they can rent a bike for short or longer distances. In particular, shared bikes are used to go to work, the gym, to school, to meet friends, etc. Thus, many stations are strategically distributed throughout the city, i.e. close to the most frequented public places, allowing people to easily and affordably rent and return the bikes from one mobility hub to another - Source.Note this dataset is only for February,2019
